* Welcome to CS 378! We are going to learn about virtualization
technologies, and we are going to do some interesting projects. This
is a project-intensive course.

* I **don't teach with slides**. This is going to be a
  discussion-based class. I'll make notes like these available, but
  you need to pay attention in class.

* There are two projects in this class: an implementation-based
  project and an open-source project. Most of the learning will come
  from doing the projects!

* You can optionally do a research project with me instead of the
  open-source project. Come talk to me early if you want to do this.
    
* Students learn a lot from doing the open-source project, but it
  takes a lot of time to set up. Start work on this early!
    
* History of Virtualization
    * Virtual machines go back to at least 1969: [PDP-10 Virtual Machines](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=803947)
    * Seminal work came out around this time: [Formal Requirements for Virtualizable Third Generation Architectures](https://profsandhu.com/cs6393_s14/popek-goldberg-1974.pdf)
