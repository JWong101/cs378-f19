* Welcome to CS 378! We are going to learn about virtualization
technologies, and we are going to do some interesting projects. This
is a project-intensive course.

* I **don't teach with slides**. This is going to be a
  discussion-based class. I'll make notes like these available, but
  you need to pay attention in class.

* There are two projects in this class: an implementation-based
  project and an open-source project. Most of the learning will come
  from doing the projects!

* Students learn a lot from doing the open-source project, but it
  takes a lot of time to set up. Start work on this early!
